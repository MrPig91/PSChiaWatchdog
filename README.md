# PSChiaWatchdog
This module hosts some scripts for setting up a basic Chia Watchdog using powershell.

These scripts have been tested and do work as expected, however this is NOT a robust or full fledge Chia Watchdog program. These scripts are for demostration purposes. They can be used to get an idea of how to start building your own watch dog service using powershell or just run a VERY basic version using the provideded scripts that have no error handling.

No gurantees that these will work out of the box for you or on your system. I might make a more robust version in the future and pack it into a module however I have no time frame of when this will be as I seem to be overly ambitious with ideas.
